# RunJump

A simple mobile game made in [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/) and named after the only things you can do in it: run and jump. You control a square and have to jump between platforms that move increasingly faster. If you fall to the bottom of the screen, you lose.

To jump, click/tap the screen. Hold the click/tap to jump higher.

**Target Godot version:** 3.5.1
